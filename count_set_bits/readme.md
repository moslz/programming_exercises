#### `count_set_bits` Function

The `count_set_bits` function takes a non-negative integer as input and counts the number of set bits (bits with a value of 1) in its binary representation. The function calculates the count of set bits by examining each bit in the binary representation of the input integer and returns the result.

#### Usage

```python
from your_module import count_set_bits

# Example
count = count_set_bits(223)
print(count)  # Output:7 
# 223 in binary is shown like 11011111
