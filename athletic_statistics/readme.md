**Race Results Statistics**

This Python script calculates statistics for race results of teams of runners. The statistics include the range, average, and median of race times.

**Usage:**

1. Input a string containing individual race times in "hh|mm|ss" format, separated by commas.
2. The script will calculate the range (difference between the lowest and highest times), average (mean of all times), and median (middle value of sorted times).
3. The results are formatted as "Range: hh|mm|ss Average: hh|mm|ss Median: hh|mm|ss".

**Example:**

Input:
"01|15|59, 1|47|6, 01|17|20, 1|32|34, 2|3|17"


Output:
"Range: 00|47|18 Average: 01|35|15 Median: 01|32|34"
