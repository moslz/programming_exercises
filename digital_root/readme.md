**`digital_root` Function**

The `digital_root` function in Python takes a non-negative integer `n` and calculates its digital root. The digital root is found by repeatedly summing the digits of `n` until a single-digit number is obtained.

**Usage:**

```python
result = digital_root(942)  # 9 + 4 + 2 = 15 -> 1 + 5 = 6  Output: 6
```

The function is useful for simplifying numbers to their core single-digit value.
