**`domain_extraction` Function**

The `domain_extraction` function is a Python function that extracts and returns the domain name from a given URL as a string.

**Usage:**

```python
print (domain_extraction ("https://www.bing.com/videos"))  # "bing"
```

**How It Works:**

1. Removes "http://", "https://", and "www." prefixes.
2. Extracts the domain name by finding the first dot (.) in the URL.
3. Returns the extracted domain name as a string.

This function simplifies working with domain names in URLs.
