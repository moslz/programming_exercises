# Sum of Multiples of 3 and 5 Below a Given Number

This short Python function calculates the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below a given number. If the number passed in is negative, it returns 0. It also ensures that if a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it is only counted once in the sum.

## Example

If you run the program with an input of 10, it will return the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 10, which is 23 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9).

## Special Cases

- If you pass a negative number to the `solution` function, it will return 0.
- The function handles the case where a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 correctly by counting it only once in the sum.
